### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Implement THREE.js, spacekit.js, and react three fiber to create a 3d solar system
- Use NASA API to display dynamic and static information about all 9 planets and the sun
- Allow users to create a username, password, and avatar
- Display username and avatar in Navbar

#### PostMVP

- Use THREE.js to import flight controls and allow signed in users to traverse the 3d solar system in first person
- Allow a 3rd person display with selectable rocket ships
- Create an Ephemerides calculator to display planetary alignment in realtime
